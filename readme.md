# Lil-Ref
An original character directory template.
Inspired by sites like [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se) and [RefSheet](https://refsheet.net).

You can see the demo here: [demo](https://rodfireproductions.github.io/Lil-Ref/)

The spiritual predecessor of [RefMine](https://refmine.shroom.ink),
a project that got rewritten multiple times but never released.
A project I started when I was a lot less experienced.
I just needed to restart again with a blank slate.

Features
- Two layout styles: Wiki, and Full-Body.

## Set Up Locally

Pre-requisites:
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Once Jekyll is installed, open the project folder in your command prompt and run this:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Your site should be available at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

## Creating Character Pages

It uses the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) syntax.

## License
Lil-Ref's code is licensed under the [Do What The F*ck You Want To Public License](https://github.com/RodFireProductions/Lil-Ref/blob/master/LICENSE).

Basically, you can do whatever you want with this.
