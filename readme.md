# Lil-Ref
An original character directory template.
Inspired by sites like [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se) and [RefSheet](https://refsheet.net).

The spiritual predecessor of [RefMine](https://refmine.shroom.ink),
a project that got rewritten multiple times but never released.
A project I started when I was a lot less experienced.
I just needed to restart again with a blank slate.
